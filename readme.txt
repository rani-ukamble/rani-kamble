Welcome to my portfolio! I specialize in a range of technical skills, from advanced programming and web development to data science and machine learning. With a strong foundation in Python and C++, I excel in building efficient algorithms and object-oriented designs. My expertise extends to web development, where I create responsive and interactive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask.

In the realm of data science, I am adept at analyzing data, building predictive models, and visualizing results. My work in image processing and generative AI showcases my ability to innovate with cutting-edge technologies. I am proficient in tools like Docker, Git, and databases such as SQL and MongoDB, and I am comfortable working on both Linux and Windows operating systems.

Beyond technical skills, I value problem-solving, collaboration, and effective communication. Teaching is also a passion of mine, allowing me to share knowledge and inspire others.
